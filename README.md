# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Project Overview
This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset, focusing on passenger survival patterns. Using Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, we analyze survival rates by different factors and visualize the data to gain meaningful insights.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Loading the Titanic dataset and understanding its structure.
- **Data Analysis**: Exploring survival rates by gender, class, and age.
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Survival rates by gender and class using bar plots.
  - Age distribution of passengers using histograms.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - Seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
  - Matplotlib: For creating plots and graphs.

## Visualizations
### Sample Visualizations:
1. **Survival Rate by Gender**: Bar plot displaying survival rate differences between male and female passengers.
2. **Survival Rate by Class**: Visualization of survival patterns across passenger classes (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
3. **Age Distribution**: Histogram showing the distribution of passenger ages.

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to see the visualizations and insights.
- Modify or extend the analysis as needed to explore additional patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Further analysis on additional features such as fare, embarkation location, and family size.
- More advanced visualizations and survival prediction models.
